## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Admin link not showing
**Solution:**
- Verify user role in MongoDB Atlas (should be "ADMIN")
- Check browser console for session data
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to clear cache
- Logout and login again

### Issue: 403 Forbidden on admin routes
**Solution:**
- Verify AdminOnlyGuard is working
- Check JWT token includes role field
- Verify middleware is protecting routes
- Check backend logs for auth errors

### Issue: Stats not loading
**Solution:**
- Check backend logs for errors
- Verify MongoDB connection
- Test /admin/stats endpoint directly
- Check CORS settings

### Issue: Invite codes not working
**Solution:**
- Verify InvitesModule is imported in app.module.ts
- Check invite code in database (MongoDB Atlas)
- Verify expiration date is in the future
- Check invite hasn't been fully used
